## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-12

FMG-specific safety additions (bundle D of [#11](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/11)): preview-before-install gate, ADOM workspace-lock tracking with shutdown release, and per-item bulk delete reporting. 421 unit tests pass.

### Added
- **Preview-before-install gate** (`utils/install_gate.py` + `FMG_INSTALL_SAFETY`). By default (`strict`) `install_package` refuses a real install unless a `preview_install` for the same ADOM + package + device set is on record and its FMG task finished successfully (verified live via `get_task` at install time). Previews expire after 30 minutes and are single-use — each authorizes exactly one install, because the package may change in between. `warn` installs but returns a warning; `disabled` restores previous behavior. Same setting shape as `FMG_SCRIPT_SAFETY` / `FMG_POLICY_SAFETY`. `install_package(preview=True)` is itself a dry run and bypasses the gate. **Upgrade note:** agents that installed without previewing must now run `preview_install` + `wait_for_task` first, or the operator sets `FMG_INSTALL_SAFETY=warn`/`disabled`.
- **ADOM workspace-lock tracking + shutdown release** (`utils/adom_locks.py`). `lock_adom`/`unlock_adom` now track which ADOMs this server locked; at server shutdown (both lifecycle owners) any still-held lock is released best-effort — shielded, bounded by 5s per unlock — before the client disconnects, so an agent that errored out between lock and unlock doesn't leave the ADOM blocking other admins. Deliberately **no** auto-unlock on individual tool failure: the agent may be mid-workflow (lock → change → retry → commit → unlock) and yanking the lock would discard the workspace session it is still using.

### Changed
- **`delete_firewall_policies_bulk` reports per-item results.** Previously one filtered DELETE reported `len(policyids)` as deleted no matter how many IDs actually matched, and one bad ID failed the whole call opaquely. Now each policy is deleted individually and the response carries `status: success|partial|error`, `deleted` (IDs), and `failed` (`{policyid, message, error_code}` per item).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-12

Async-task contract (bundle C of [#11](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/11)): anti-exhaustion guards for the FMG task lifecycle — bounded concurrent task spawns, deadline-bounded status polls, and a shared poll-recovery budget. Adapted from the FortiAnalyzer MCP's logsearch guards ([fortianalyzer-mcp#18](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/18)). 400 unit tests pass.

### Added
- **Shared in-flight task budget** (`utils/task_guard.py`). The seven task-spawning tools (`install_package`, `install_device_settings`, `preview_install`, `execute_script_on_device/devices/device_group/package`) now share one in-process budget of `TASK_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 5` concurrent FMG tasks, so a caller cannot slam the FMG with 20 parallel installs. The slot is reserved *before* the submit is awaited (racing spawns cannot overshoot), bound to the returned task id, and released when `wait_for_task` observes a terminal state — or reclaimed after `TASK_SLOT_TTL` (30 min) for callers that never poll. When the budget is full the tool fails fast with a structured `task_slots_exhausted` envelope naming the in-flight kinds, rather than queueing the MCP request.
- **Deadline-bounded task polling in `wait_for_task`.** Each `get_task` poll is bounded by `asyncio.wait_for` (`POLL_CALL_TIMEOUT = 30s`), the overall wait is clamped to `MAX_TASK_WAIT_TIMEOUT = 3600s`, and `poll_interval` is clamped to `[1, 60]` so a 0 interval cannot hot-loop. Wedged polls re-poll on a shared budget of `MAX_TASK_POLL_FAILURES = 3` (the FMG analog of FAZ's `MAX_SEARCH_REISSUES`), then surface a structured `task_poll_failed` envelope. Persistent API errors still surface immediately — `get_task` already retries transients internally, so re-polling those here would be wrong.

### Notes (FMG adaptations of the FAZ pattern)
- **No automatic cleanup-cancel of FMG tasks.** FAZ cancels an orphaned logsearch (read-only, single-use tid). An FMG task is a config-mutating install or script run: auto-cancelling one mid-flight because the *poll* was aborted risks a half-applied install, which is worse than letting the task finish unobserved. Exhaustion protection comes from the slot TTL instead.
- The `assign_*` bulk operations named in #11 turn out to be synchronous (no task id in their responses), so they need no guard. The guard is one `spawn_guarded(...)` wrapper per call site if other spawn sites (e.g. dvm `create_task`-flag tools, `validate_template`) should be added later.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-12

Fail closed: the streamable-HTTP transport now refuses to start without `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` unless the operator explicitly opts out with `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`. Forward-port of [fortianalyzer-mcp#25](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/25); completes bundle B of [#11](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/11). 428 unit tests pass.

### Changed
- **The HTTP transport now fails closed when `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset.** The streamable-HTTP server fronts the full tool surface (including device add/delete, policy install, and script execution on managed devices), so it previously could serve everything unauthenticated if the token was simply forgotten. `run_http()` now refuses to start without a token and exits with a message that names the fix, unless the operator explicitly opts out with `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` (logged at CRITICAL; intended only for a trusted, isolated bind such as 127.0.0.1 behind a gateway). **Upgrade note:** a deployment that ran on a `0.0.0.0` bind without a token must now set either `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true` to keep starting.

### Added
- `MCP_ALLOW_NO_AUTH` setting (default `false`) — the explicit opt-out for running HTTP without a token. 4 tests cover token-set start, no-token fail-closed, empty-token fail-closed, and the explicit opt-out.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-12

Three bugs found and fixed by live verification against a lab FortiManager 7.6.7 (v7.6.7-build3737). 388 unit tests pass.

### Fixed
- **Script target enum was swapped on the FMG 7.6+ endpoint** — every `execute_script_on_package` call failed with `-8 Invalid parameter`. `_SCRIPT_TARGET_MAP` had `adom_database=1 / remote_device=2`; verified by execution (a create+get round-trip cannot detect a swap because the mapping is symmetric): a `target=2` script executes against a policy package and spawns a task, a `target=1` script accepts a device-scoped execute. Correct map: `device_database=0, remote_device=1, adom_database=2`. Scripts created through the MCP with `target="adom_database"` were actually stored as remote-device scripts and vice versa.
- **`add_model_device` omitted the `mr` field** — every model-device add failed with `Unsupported device/ADOM version`. FMG expects the major version in `os_ver` (`"7.0"`) and the minor in a separate `mr` integer. The tool now splits `os_version` "X.Y" into `os_ver="X.0"` + `mr=Y` (verified live: device lands as FortiOS 7.6).
- **FMG error-code table corrected to live-verified semantics.** The previous table mislabeled most codes: `-2` is "Object already exists" (was: invalid session — a duplicate create triggered a spurious re-login + retry), `-3` is "Object does not exist" (was: permission denied), `-8` is "Invalid parameter" (was: ADOM locked), `-10` is "data invalid for selected URL" (was: version mismatch), and `-11` is "no permission / **stale session**" (was: task timeout, retried twice with the same dead session). Newly mapped: `-22` login fail, `-10147` no write permission, `-20055` workspace locked by another admin. Consequences: `_RECONNECTABLE_ERROR_CODES` is now `{-11}` — the reconnect-once path (#14/#16) now actually triggers on the code the FMG emits for a stale session — and `_TRANSIENT_ERROR_CODES` is `{-1}`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-10

Hardening pass: ports the FortiAnalyzer MCP's resilience and observability patterns (PRs [fortianalyzer-mcp#17](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/17), [#18](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/pull/18), [#22](https://github.com/rstierli/fortianalyzer-mcp/issues/22) by Christian Dassy / [@inxbit](https://github.com/inxbit)) over to FortiManager. Tracked in #11. 424 unit tests pass.

### Added
- **Shared error envelope + secret redactor** ([#12](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/pull/12)). New `utils/responses.py` provides `error_response(error, message, operation, ...)` — one structured envelope used by every tool error path with stable machine code, redacted + length-bounded human text, optional `adom`/`package`/`device`/`task_id` fields included only when supplied. `redact()` scrubs `key=value` / `key: value` pairs whose key matches `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` (excluding the generic words `key`/`auth`/`pass` to avoid mangling policy names) and masks long hex token-like runs. Tool wiring to use the envelope ships in a follow-up.
- **`FORTIMANAGER_VERIFY_SSL=false` connect-time warning** ([#13](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/pull/13)). When SSL verification is disabled, a single `logger.warning` at connect time names the host, mentions the env var by name, and nudges toward importing the FortiManager CA into the system trust store. Default remains `True` (v1.3.0 stability); anyone hitting this warning has explicitly opted into insecure.
- **`async ensure_connected()` + serialized reconnect-once foundation** ([#14](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/pull/14)). Tools call `await client.ensure_connected()` before requests so idle-closed sessions are transparently revived instead of surfacing raw "Not connected" errors. `_force_reconnect()` is serialized via `asyncio.Lock` + generation counter so concurrent dropped-session callers only re-log in **once**; the rest observe the bumped generation and bail out.
- **Bounded transient-retry wrapper wired through every API method** ([#16](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/pull/16)). New `_execute_resilient()` runs each request with reconnect-once on session error (auth, codes `-2`/`-20`/`-21`, raw "Not connected" when previously connected) and bounded transient retry on `OSError` or codes `-1`/`-11` with exponential backoff (`0.5s`, `1.0s`). Annotates raised exceptions with `.retries_attempted` so `error_response()` surfaces `retry_count`. Every typed wrapper (101 tools) picks up the resilience without per-method changes.

### Changed
- **Server lifecycle ownership consolidated** ([#15](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/pull/15)). Dropped the top-level `lifespan()` and the `lifespan=lifespan` kwarg on `mcp = FastMCP(...)`. With `FastMCP`'s `stateless_http=True` shape that lifespan was running per request/session, connect-then-disconnect cycling the global `_fmg_client` around every call and dropping the session under concurrent requests. Lifecycle ownership now lives in exactly two paths: `run_http()` → `app_lifespan` (HTTP mode, already existed and was already correct) and a new `run_stdio()` → `stdio_main` (stdio mode). HTTP user-visible behavior is unchanged; the per-request lifespan that was running redundantly alongside `app_lifespan` is now gone.
- **Transient FMG errors are silently retried before surfacing.** Callers see slightly longer wait on a transient failure (up to ~1.5s of backoff) in exchange for the failure not happening at all most of the time. Validation, permission, not-found, and ADOM-locked errors remain surfaced immediately — these aren't transient and retrying them would be wrong.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-29

First stable release — graduated from beta.

### Security
- **Input validation enforced at tool boundaries** ([#10](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/10)): identifier parameters (`adom`, `device`, object/policy/package/template/script names) are now validated before being interpolated into API request paths, closing a path-injection vector. Object and policy name patterns permit parentheses and colons (e.g. cloned `addr (1)`, `grp:prod`); path separators, shell metacharacters, and quotes are rejected.
- **Stored scripts re-validated in the execute path** ([#10](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/10)): `execute_script_on_device/devices/group/package` now re-check the resolved script body against the safety denylist (previously only `create_script`/`update_script` were checked, so a script created with safety disabled or pre-existing on the FMG could execute unguarded). The denylist is broadened beyond destructive exec commands to cover backdoor-admin creation (`config system admin`), permissive firewall actions (`set action accept`), disabling logging (`set status disable`), and DNS/route changes — with whitespace normalization to prevent spacing/case bypass.
- **API error bodies sanitized** ([#10](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/10)): tool errors now return a generic message plus an error code instead of the raw FortiManager error text, preventing internal endpoint paths from leaking to the caller. Full detail is still logged server-side.
- **Pinned `pyfmg` dependency** ([#10](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/10)) to a specific commit instead of a floating fork reference.

### Changed
- **Stability promotion:** no functional changes beyond the security hardening above. TLS guidance now recommends importing the FortiManager CA certificate; `FORTIMANAGER_VERIFY_SSL=false` is documented only as a warned last resort, and shipped example configs default to verification enabled.

## [1.2.2-beta] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **Script `target` field mapping for FMG 7.6+ endpoint** ([#3](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/3)): the new `/pm/config/.../obj/fmg/script` endpoint stores `target` as an integer, but the client was passing the documented strings (`device_database`, `adom_database`, `remote_device`). FMG silently coerced unknown values to `0`, causing scripts intended for remote devices or ADOM database to land on the wrong target. The client now maps strings ↔ ints transparently. Verified live against FMG 7.6.6.
- **`list_scripts` target filter mapping** ([#7](https://github.com/rstierli/fortimanager-mcp/issues/7)): the same string-vs-int mismatch broke filter expressions like `["target", "==", "remote_device"]` on FMG 7.6+. Filter walker now handles both the binary triplet form and the multi-value `in`/`!in` flat-list form (`["target", "in", v1, v2, ...]`). Operator-aware: only documented FMG comparison operators trigger value mapping.

### Changed
- Cleared mypy strict-mode baseline: 75 errors → 0. Seven real type bugs fixed (filter signatures, `_get_client` return annotations across tool modules, list element type, pydantic-settings false positive). The 68 pyfmg SDK passthrough errors are silenced via a documented per-module override; all other strict checks remain active.
- Bumped GitHub Actions to Node 24 majors ahead of the June 2, 2026 forced cutover.

## [1.2.1-beta] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Consolidated duplicate `parse_fmg_error` — removed simple version from client.py, now uses the comprehensive version from errors.py

### Added
- Usage disclaimer in README

## [1.2.0-beta] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`get_policy_services` tool** — Retrieve services configured on a firewall policy with optional group resolution. Enables automated policy hardening workflows by comparing actual traffic (from FortiAnalyzer) against configured services.

### Security
- **Script content safety** (`FMG_SCRIPT_SAFETY`) — Blocks dangerous CLI commands (`execute factory-reset`, `reboot`, `shutdown`, `format`, `erase-disk`) in `create_script` and `update_script`. Enabled by default (`strict`), set to `disabled` to override.
- **Policy permissiveness safety** (`FMG_POLICY_SAFETY`) — Blocks overly permissive firewall policies (srcaddr=all + dstaddr=all + action=accept) in `create_firewall_policy` and `update_firewall_policy`. Modes: `strict` (default, blocks), `warn` (allows with warning), `disabled`.
- Both safety guardrails are **strict by default** — require explicit env var override to disable.
- 40 new tests covering all safety validation and tool integration.

## [0.1.0-beta] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Unit tests expanded** - 213 tests covering errors, validation, and tool modules
- **Version-aware script endpoints** - Automatically selects correct API endpoint based on FMG version (7.6+ uses `/pm/config`, 7.0-7.4 uses `/dvmdb`)

### Fixed

- E402 linting errors for post-dotenv imports

### Technical
- All CI checks passing
- Integration tests verified against FMG 7.6.2
